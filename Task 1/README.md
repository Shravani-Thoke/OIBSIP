🌸 Task 1 – IRIS flower classification
Oasis Infobyte – Data Science Internship

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

The classification is performed based on four numerical features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

This is a supervised classification problem.

📊 Dataset Information

The dataset used is the classic Iris dataset, which contains:

150 samples

4 numerical features

3 target classes (flower species)

The dataset is clean and contains no missing values.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

🔍 Steps Performed
1️⃣ Data Exploration (EDA)

Checked dataset structure using .info()

Verified missing values

Checked duplicate records

Visualized feature distributions using boxplots

2️⃣ Data Preparation

Defined feature matrix (X)

Defined target variable (y)

Split dataset into training and testing sets (80/20 split)

3️⃣ Model Building

Used K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier

Trained the model using training data

4️⃣ Model Evaluation

Predicted test data results

Calculated accuracy score

5️⃣ Sample Prediction

Tested the model with custom sample input

Successfully predicted the species

📈 Model Performance
