📊 Task 2 – Unemployment Analysis in India
Oasis Infobyte – Data Science Internship
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing unemployment trends in India, especially examining the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment rates across different regions.

The goal was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and derive meaningful insights using time-series visualization and aggregation techniques.

📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains:

Region-wise unemployment data

Estimated unemployment rate (%)

Labour participation rate

Date column

State-level observations

The dataset required cleaning and preprocessing before analysis.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

🔍 Steps Performed
1️⃣ Data Cleaning

Checked for missing values

Removed null entries

Converted Date column into datetime format

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed overall unemployment trends

Segmented data into:

Pre-COVID period

During-COVID period

Visualized unemployment rate over time

3️⃣ National Trend Analysis

Used groupby() to calculate average unemployment rate by date

Plotted time-series graph to identify spikes during COVID

4️⃣ Regional Comparison

Compared unemployment rates across regions using bar plots

Identified most affected regions during COVID

📈 Key Insights

Significant spike in unemployment during COVID-19

Noticeable regional variation in unemployment rates

Clear time-based trend shifts due to economic disruptions

🧠 Key Learnings

Time-series data handling

Data aggregation using Pandas

Visualization of economic indicators

Real-world data analysis workflow

🚀 Future Improvements

Seasonal decomposition analysis

Predictive modeling of unemployment trends

Interactive dashboards using Plotly
